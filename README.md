# üêß Operating System Simulation Tools

When I studied operations I learned a lot of theory about them, this repository is focused on simulating part of those theories.

All programs implemented here require Qt5, but depending on the operating system you have, you may need to install it differently if you don't have it yet.

## Installation
Linux : 
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
Windows :
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

These programs are made and tested in Linux, I have not checked the portability in Windows, but there should not be any problem at first, even so, I recommend using a Unix-based system.

**‚ìò Important:** <br />
* These programs implement dark mode by default, Qt5 doesn't really provide a style like this in its libraries (at least as far as I know), so I implemented my own 'dark_mode.css', you can use it in your programs if you want.
* The code in this repository is open-source, but even so, it has been used in the subject of operating systems during my study stay, I prohibit using them in an academic manner.
